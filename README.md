# Power-Bi--Business-Insights-360


AtliQ Hardware is the one of the fastest-growing companies in the hardware market, recently shifted to a data-driven approach to make more accurate business decisions. After facing significant losses in Latin America due to decisions based on Surveys or intuition, AtliQ’s leadership invested in data analytics to turn raw data into actionable insights.🚀

# Challenge:

As an aspiring data analyst, I recently created a dashboard with pages for Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive View. This setup helped AtliQ get clear insights for each area, making it easier to make informed decisions and plan for the future.

Key highlights:

✔Built a comprehensive dashboard covering Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain View.

✔Strengthened skills in Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Data Transformation.

✔Gained hands-on experience with DAX, Different Visuals, Measures, and KPIs.

I explained all about my projects on Presentation Video & Dashboard
